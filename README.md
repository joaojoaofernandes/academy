# Java full stack academy
## Goals
The main objective of the academy is to give you knowledge of the necessary tools so that you can participate in a full stack project and not feel lost.

This course will provide you the bases about tooling, operations, frontend and backend development. Also will help you to understand how we work as a team at CTW.

At the end of this academy you won't be a fullstack developer and that is ok, but you'll have the tools to become one.
